This folder generates the ChoiceModels online documentation, hosted at https://choicemodels.readthedocs.io and https://docs.udst.org.


### How it works

Read the Docs builds and hosts the Sphinx pages defined in `docs/source/`. Builds are triggered when the master branch of this Github repo changes.


### Updating the documentation

The pages are built using the Sphinx documentation generator. Here's a [good tutorial](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html). Edit the `.rst` files and `conf.py` to change what appears in the rendered documentation.


### Previewing changes locally

Install `sphinx` and `sphinx_rtd_theme`.

From the `docs` directory, run `sphinx-build -b html source build` to build the documentation. HTML files will show up in `docs/build/`.

The build files won't be committed to the repo; Read the Docs will create a separate copy when the master branch is updated.


### Hosting and troubleshooting

Hosting settings are at https://readthedocs.org/projects/choicemodels/. If you don't have access, create a Read the Docs account and ask one of the existing maintainers to add you.

The DNS settings for the docs.udst.org subdomain contain a CNAME record redirecting traffic to readthedocs.io. Read the Docs handles the SSL certificate for https. 

The docs.udst.org landing page is generated by the `UDST/udst-docs` repository, with hosting settings at https://readthedocs.org/projects/udst-docs/.
